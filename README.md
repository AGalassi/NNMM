Neural Nine Men's Morris

Neural Nine Men's Morris (NNMM) is a software capable to build, train, test and use Deep Neural Networks which can be used for playing the game of Nine Men's Morris.
It has been demonstrated that the system is capable to learn to play by the rules of the game, even if the knowledge of those rules has not been provided to it.
It has been designed by Andrea Galassi, as part of his master thesis in Computer Science Engineering ("Ingegneria Informatica", in italian), and it has been improved as part of a successive work.
Please feel free to contact him (a.galassi *at* unibo.it) or his thesis supervisors (Paola Mello, paola.mello *at* unibo.it, Federico Chesani federico.chesani *at* unibo.it) for further questions.

# Implementation

The system has been written in Python language, relying on the Lasagne, Theano and Numpy libraries.
